## About the project 
I started this project for creating a personal blogging site where i can share my learning to the world, this website gradually started hitting views, sometimes 100 visits per day and one of my article in this site ranked number one for a specific keyword in google search but unfortunatly domain expired and could not afford to renew the domain, so now i offer this project to the django developers for their learning purposes :)
